## Brief Profile
Hi, I'm Orion, a Masterâ€™s student in Molecular Biology with a strong focus on bioinformatics and computational biology, aspiring to transition into a more software- and data-driven role. With a foundation in biochemistry and cell biology and hands-on experience in coding and data analysis, I bridge the gap between life sciences and computational solutions. My thesis focuses on detecting DNA recombination hotspots using population genomic data, without relying on lab experiments. Outside of academia, I develop command-line tools and RESTful APIs to automate biological workflows and continuously build my skills through coding challenges on the Rosalind platform and online courses such as IBM Data Science Professional, IBM Java Developer, and Google IT Support.

## Purpose of this Repository
The purpose of this Repository is to store the CLI (Command Line Tools) I write to solve problems on the [Rosalind Platform](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/). For those not familiar with the Rosalind Platform, it is sort of similar to LeetCode or HackerRank, but with a strong focus on bioinformatics and computational biology problems.
